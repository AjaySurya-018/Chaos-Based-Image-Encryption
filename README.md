# Chaos-Based Image Encryption and Secure Communication

This repository showcases the implementation and analysis of two chaos-based image encryption techniques: Arnold Cat Map Encryption and Henon Map Encryption. Additionally, it features a robust framework for secure communication through socket programming.

## Overview

Chaos-based encryption methods utilize the unpredictable behavior of dynamical systems to introduce pseudorandom properties in encrypted images. In this project, we explored and compared the effectiveness of two prominent chaos-based techniques for image security: Arnold Cat Map Encryption and Henon Map Encryption.

## Key Features

- **Implementation of Chaos-Based Encryption Techniques:** Implemented Arnold Cat Map Encryption and Henon Map Encryption to encrypt images, leveraging the chaotic behavior of dynamical systems to introduce pseudorandom properties.
  
- **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis:** Conducted a thorough comparative analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of both encryption techniques. This analysis focused on encryption strength, sensitivity to key changes, and resistance to cryptanalysis.
  
- **Secure Communication Framework:** Developed a client-server communication framework using socket programming to facilitate testing and validation of the encryption process. This framework ensures secure transmission of encrypted images over the network.
